# Asset Discovery

The Asset Discovery page displays information about the websites where you have deployed Alibaba Cloud SSL certificates.

After you deploy an SSL certificate for a website, the Asset Discovery page displays the information about the website, the type of the certificate, and the validity period of the certificate.

## Authorization for first use

If this is the first time that you use the Asset Discovery feature, you must authorize SSL Certificates Service to access your website resources.

![Authorization for first use](https://static-aliyun-doc.oss-accelerate.aliyuncs.com/assets/img/en-US/6502239061/p100429.png)

The authorization procedure is as follows:

1.  Log on to the SSL Certificates console. In the left-side navigation pane, click Asset Discovery. On the page that appears, click **Enable** below the prompt message.
2.  On the Cloud Resource Access Authorization page, click **Confirm Authorization Policy**.

## What to do next

You can also perform the following operations on the Asset Discovery page:

-   In the asset list, click the ![Show icon](https://static-aliyun-doc.oss-accelerate.aliyuncs.com/assets/img/en-US/6502239061/p100365.png) icon next to a base domain to show all the subdomains of the base domain and view the basic information of the SSL certificates that are deployed for these subdomains. The system displays **Domain**, **Protocol**, **SSL certificate**, and **Expire On**, which indicate the website name, certificate protocol, certificate type, and certificate expiration time, respectively.
-   If a website has **Protocol** set to **HTTP**, purchase an SSL certificate and enable the HTTPS service for the website.

    The value **HTTP** of **Protocol** indicates that no SSL certificates are deployed for the website, and the HTTPS protocol cannot be used to encrypt data transmission for the website.

-   Check the validity period of an SSL certificate. If a certificate is due to expire, we recommend that you renew the subscription in a timely manner.

    For more information, see [Renewal upon expiration](/intl.en-US/Product pricing/Renewal upon expiration.md).
