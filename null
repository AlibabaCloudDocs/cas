# Download certificates

SSL Certificates Service allows you to download SSL certificates and install them on your web server. After an SSL certificate is installed, the website to which the certificate is bound communicates by using the Secure Sockets Layer \(SSL\) protocol to ensure data transmission security. This topic shows you how to download SSL certificates for different types of servers.

## Procedure

**Note:** SSL Certificates Service allows you to download an SSL certificate in the **Issued**, **Expired**, or **Pending Expiration** state. You cannot download SSL certificates in other states.

1.  On the **SSL Certificates Service** page, find the certificate that you want to download, and click **Download** in the **Actions** column.

2.  Find the server type for which you want to install the SSL certificate in the **Server Type** column, and click **Download** in the **Actions** column to download the package to your on-premises machine.

3.  Decompress the package and install the SSL certificate on your web server.

    The SSL certificates that you purchase by using SSL Certificates Service can be installed on web servers of the following types:
