# What should I do when my SSL certificate expires?

When your SSL certificate expires, it becomes unavailable. You must purchase another one. After purchasing a new certificate, you need to re-bind the domain name and submit materials for review.

Once the review process is complete, a new certificate is issued. To replace the expired certificate, you must install the new SSL certificate on your server.

**Note:** Purchase the replacement certificate three to ten working days before certificate expiration so that the new certificate can be reviewed before the existing certificate expires.
