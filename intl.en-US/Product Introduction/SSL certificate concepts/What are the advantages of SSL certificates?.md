# What are the advantages of SSL certificates?

This topic describes the advantages of SSL certificates compared with traditional encryption methods.

-   **Quick deployment**: You need only to apply for an SSL certificate and deploy it on your server.
-   **Intuitive display**: After you deploy an SSL certificate on your server and access your website over HTTPS, a lock icon appears in the address bar or on the right of the address bar. This icon indicates that the website is encrypted. If you deploy an Extended Validation \(EV\) certificate, the enterprise name also appears in the address bar.
-   **Identity authentication**: This feature is unavailable in other encryption methods. You can view the owner enterprise of the website in the SSL certificate information, and then check whether the website is valid and authentic. This prevents you from phishing attacks.
-   **Quick issuance**: Certificate application is easy and efficient. You can purchase SSL certificates of different brands in the Alibaba Cloud SSL Certificates Service console at a time. Alibaba Cloud can accelerate the review and issuance of SSL certificates.
-   **Easy deployment**: You can deploy SSL certificates to your Alibaba Cloud services, such as Server Load Balancer \(SLB\), Alibaba Cloud CDN, Secure CDN \(SCDN\), and Dynamic Route for CDN \(DCDN\). This way, you can use the certificates in the cloud at minimal cost.
