# What is SSL Certificates? {#concept_xn2_52p_ydb .concept}

SSL Certificates is an Alibaba Cloud digital server certificate service. This service provides digital server certificates issued by CAs in China and abroad on the Alibaba Cloud platform. You can obtain free digital certificates or purchase other required types of certificates on the Alibaba Cloud platform. You can deploy these certificates in Alibaba Cloud products to convert your service from HTTP-based to HTTPS-based with minimal costs. This enables your websites to implement identity verification and data transmission encryption.

## Concepts {#section_bxf_5xt_lgb .section}

The following introduces the concepts of Alibaba Cloud SSL Certificates.

-   **What is a digital certificate?** 

    A digital certificate is a document signed by a trusted authority. The certificate contains information about the public key owner and the public key file. It is a trusted credential issued by an authority to the website. The simplest certificate contains a public key, a certificate name, and a digital signature signed by a CA.

    An important feature of Digital certificates is that they are only valid for a specific period of time.

-   **What is SSL?**

    SSL is a security protocol that implements network communication encryption. SSL establishes an encrypted channel between a browser and a website to prevent data tampering or interception during transmission.

-   **What is an SSL certificate?**

    An SSL certificate is a trusted certificate issued to a website by a certificate authority and uses the SSL protocol for communication.

    An SSL certificate uses the SSL protocol for communication. After an SSL certificate is deployed on a Web server, HTTPS is enabled for the Web server. Your website will transmit data through HTTPS, which helps the Web server and the website establish a trusted encrypted connection to ensure the security of data transmission.

-   **What is HTTPS?**

    HTTPS is a website encrypted transmission protocol based on the SSL protocol.

    After the SSL certificate is deployed on a website, you can enable HTTPS to activate **the SSL encrypted channel** \(SSL protocol\) between a client browser and the website server. This enables bidirectional encrypted transmission and prevents content tampering or interception. HTTPS \(HTTP over SSL or HTTP Secure\) is the secure version of HTTP.

-   **What is CA?**

    A CA is a certificate authority.

    As a trusted third party in an e-commerce transaction, CA is responsible for verifying the validity of the public keys in the public key system.
