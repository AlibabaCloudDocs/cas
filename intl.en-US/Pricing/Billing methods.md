## SSL Certificates Service

Certificates of different types and brands are differently priced. For more information about certificate prices, see [SSL Certificates Service buy page](https://common-buy-intl.aliyun.com/?commodityCode=cas_intl#/buy).

## Expiration

If your purchased SSL certificates or value-added services expire, they are automatically stopped. Take note of the following points:

-   Seven days before your SSL certificates or services expire, you are notified by emails or text messages to promptly renew the SSL certificates or services. If you do not renew the SSL certificates or services before they expire, your website can no longer provide HTTPS-encrypted data transmission.
-   After expiration, the system retains the settings of your SSL certificates and value-added services for seven days. If you renew the SSL certificates and services within the seven days, you can directly use the original settings. If you do not renew the certificates and services within the seven days, the settings are cleared. If this happens, you must purchase SSL certificates and value-added services and configure the settings again.
