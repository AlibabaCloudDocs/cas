To request a fee-based certificate, you must select the certificate type, the number of domains, and the certificate brand. Then you must pay for the certificate, enter certificate and request details, and submit for review .

The question of overdue payment does not arise because you are required to pay first to activate the service.

## Renew {#section_osc_vfp_ydb .section}

If your digital certificate is about to expire, you can submit a new request for review by using the original purchase conditions and request records. To make the process easier, we recommend that your review materials must be identical to the materials used during the first or previous purchase. In case of any changes in the materials, you have to again follow the review process for new certificate purchases.
