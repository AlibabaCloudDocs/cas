# Billing

SSL Certificates Service allows you to purchase SSL certificates that are billed on a subscription basis. This topic describes the billing of SSL Certificates Service.

## Subscription SSL certificates

If you purchase a subscription SSL certificate in the SSL Certificates Service console, you can select one year as the subscription duration.

For more information about certificate prices, visit [SSL Certificates Service buy page](https://common-buy-intl.aliyun.com/?commodityCode=cas_intl#/buy).

## Expiration

If your purchased SSL certificates or value-added services expire, they are automatically stopped.

-   You are notified by emails or text messages seven days before expiration. If you do not renew the certificates or services before they expire, your website can no longer provide HTTPS-encrypted data transmission.
-   After expiration, the system retains the settings of your SSL certificates and value-added services for seven days. If you renew the certificates and services within the seven days, you can directly use the original settings. If you do not renew the certificates and services within the seven days, the settings are cleared. If this happens, you must configure the settings again when you purchase SSL certificates or value-added services.
