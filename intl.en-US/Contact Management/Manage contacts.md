# Manage contacts

When you submit a certificate application, you must provide contact information so that the CA staff can contact you to validate and approve your certificate application. After you create a contact, SSL Certificates Service automatically saves the contact information for later use. This topic describes how to create, edit, and delete a contact.

## Create a contact

You can create a contact by using one of the following methods:

-   Log on to the [SSL Certificates Service console](https://yundunnext.console.aliyun.com/?p=cas) and open the **Information Management** page. Then, click Create Contact on the **Contact** tab. The following procedure is based on this method.
-   When you submit a certificate application, select **Create Contact** from the **Contact** drop-down list. If you use this method, the system automatically saves the contact information that you enter to the **Contact** tab of the **Information Management** page. You do not need to enter the information again the next time you submit a certificate application.

**Procedure**

1.  Log on to the [SSL Certificates Service console](https://yundunnext.console.aliyun.com/?p=cas).

2.  In the left-side navigation pane, click **Information Management**.

3.  On the **Contact** tab, click **Create Contact**.

4.  In the **Create Contact** dialog box, specify **Contact Name**, **Email Address**, **Mobile Number**, and **ID Card Number**.

    **Note:** Make sure that the contact information you enter is true and valid. This way, the CA staff can contact you to confirm the validation and approval of your certificate application or discuss any technical issues.

## What to do next

When you submit a certificate application, you can select an existing contact from the **Contact** drop-down list. For more information, see [Step 1: Fill in certificate application information](/intl.en-US/Issue Certificates/Application process/Apply for and validate certificates.md). CA staff contact you to validate and approve your certificate application. For example, the CA staff can send a domain verification email to the email address specified in the contact that you select or call the specified mobile number to confirm validation.
