# What do I do when an SSL certificate expires? {#concept_a45_jvv_ydb .concept}

You must renew your SSL certificate, if your SSL digital certificate expires. Because, an SSL digital certificate becomes unusable after its expiry. Once the renewal process is completed, the certificate service system collects and uses the information of the current certificate order to create a new SSL certificate order. This certificate is auto submitted for review.

Once the review process is successfully completed, a new certificate is issued. To replace the expired certificate, you must install this new certificate on your server.
