# OSS users apply for SSL certificates {#concept_85024_zh .concept}

This topic describes how Alibaba Cloud OSS users apply for SSL certificates.

You can perform the following operations on your SSL certificate in OSS console:

1.  Apply for a new SSL certificate.

    The path for applying for an SSL certificate is as follows: **Your Buckets for applying SSL certificate** \> **Domain Names** \> **Certificate Service**.

2.  Manage your SSL certificate.
3.  Upload an existing SSL certificate for hosting.

If DNS resolution is not in Alibaba Cloud, the certificate you applied for cannot be automatically issued. You need to go to the SSL Certificates console to finish the process as instructed in **Status**.

If you are not familiar with the process of configuring DNS resolution, we recommend that you transfer DNS resolution to Alibaba Cloud and authorize the DNS console to automatically configure DNS resolution. After DNS resolution is finished, your SSL certificate can be issued. If you do not transfer DNS resolution to Alibaba Cloud, you need to go to the third-party DNS resolution console and configure the specified TXT file for authentication and resolution. This demonstrates your control permissions for the domain name so that your SSL certificate can be issued.

If a large number of SSL certificates need to be issued, transferring your DNS resolution to Alibaba Cloud can greatly reduce the workload of certificate application and management.
