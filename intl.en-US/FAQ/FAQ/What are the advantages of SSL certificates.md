# What are the advantages of SSL certificates {#concept_mcs_2pp_ydb .concept}

SSL certificates offer the following advantages over traditional encryption methods:

-   Simplified operations: You only need to apply for a certificate and deploy it on your web server. No further actions are required within the validity of the certificate.
-   Intuitive display: After the SSL certificate is deployed, an encryption lock icon is displayed in, or to the right of, the address bar when you access your website over HTTPS, indicating you website is encrypted. If an EV certificate is deployed, you will be able to view the company name.
-   Authentication: Visitors can conveniently see the website owner information from the certificate details, enhancing user trust in your website.
