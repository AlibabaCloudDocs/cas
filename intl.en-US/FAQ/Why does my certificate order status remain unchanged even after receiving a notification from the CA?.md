# Why does my certificate order status remain unchanged even after receiving a notification from the CA? {#concept_ufx_xs5_ydb .concept}

The reason can be, the CA may first try to contact you \(may send email updates to you \(the requester\)\)

before pushing review updates to Alibaba Cloud, resulting into

a delay in updating your certificate status.
