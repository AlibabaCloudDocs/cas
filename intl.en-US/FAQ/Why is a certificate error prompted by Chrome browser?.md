# Why is a certificate error prompted by Chrome browser? {#concept_wdh_rrp_ydb .concept}

When browsing your website that has an SSL certificate deployed in a Chrome browser, the message "NET::ERR\_CERTIFICATE\_TRANSPARENCY\_REQUIRED" is displayed.

From November 2016, you may experience the "NET::ERR\_CERTIFICATE\_TRANSPARENCY\_REQUIRED" error when using Google’s Chrome browser 53 and QQ browser 9.5.1 \(with built-in Chrome 53 kernel\) to visit HTTPS websites.  This exception is caused by a bug in Chrome browser 53. To resolve this issue, use a Chrome browser version different to the 53 version.
