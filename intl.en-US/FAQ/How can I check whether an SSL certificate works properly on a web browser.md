# How can I check whether an SSL certificate works properly on a web browser {#concept_tl3_qvv_ydb .concept}

SSL digital certificates must be issued by a trusted root certificate authority in the web browser after the server authentication is completed. An SSL certificate provides both website authentication and encrypted transmission.

If you can access your website with https:// after an SSL certificate is deployed, it indicates that the certificate is successfully deployed to your website.

## To test the SSL certificate, follow these steps: {#section_vcb_vvv_ydb .section}

1.  Type "https:// + the domain added to your digital certificate" \(for example, \`https://www.alibabacloud.com\`\) in the address bar.
2.  Press Enter.
3.  If you can access the site pages without any issue, and see a security lock icon \(green in color\) in the address bar, that means your SSL certificate has been deployed successfully.
