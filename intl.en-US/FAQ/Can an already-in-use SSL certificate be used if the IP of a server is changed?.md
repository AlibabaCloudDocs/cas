# Can an already-in-use SSL certificate be used if the IP of a server is changed? {#concept_wtp_1vv_ydb .concept}

Yes, as SSL certificates are associated with domains. Changing the IP address of a server does not affect the usage of the certificate if the domains stay the same and are resolved to a new IP address.
