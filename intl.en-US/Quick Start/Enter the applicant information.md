## Submit for verification {#section_rx1_flp_ydb .section}

After you enter the required information, submit it for verification to complete the certificate application.

We will verify your certificate qualification after receiving your submission. The time required for this process varies according to the individual requirements of each CA. We recommend that you periodically check your email and phone for notifications.

If the verification fails, the reason for the failure will be described in your order. You need to modify the application information accordingly, especially the enterprise qualification information for verification, and then re-apply.

**Note:** After receiving your submission, the CA will send you a verification email. You must follow these steps to complete the domain name verification. If you do not complete the domain name verification, you will not be able to pass the certificate verification and your certificate application will remain in the **Verifying** state.
